    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

    <h2>Use of the Application</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms & Conditions apply to the ConverterGo app (the “Application”) for mobile devices, created by Soo Chang Choi (“Service Provider”) as a freemium service.
    <p>
ConverterGo is a mobile utility application available for iOS and Android that helps users convert various units such as currency, temperature, length, weight, and more. The Applicaton is offered on a freemium basis: free to use with optional monthly or annual subscriptions. Subscription prices may vary by country and are charged through your app store account.
     <p>
      By downloading or using the Application, you agree to these terms. Unauthorized copying, modification, or extraction of source code, translation, or derivative works of the Application or our trademarks is prohibited. All intellectual property rights remain with the Service Provider.
    </p>

    <h2>User Responsibilities and Restrictions</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the Application only for lawful and appropriate purposes. You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy, modify, decompile, reverse-engineer, extract source code, or create derivative works from the Application or its components.</li>
      <li>Use the Application in any unlawful or harmful manner.</li>
      <li>Violate the intellectual property or proprietary rights of the Service Provider or any third parties.</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Applicaton's backend systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device. Using jailbroken or rooted devices may compromise the functionality and security of the Applicaton.
    </p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All intellectual property rights in the Application—including but not limited to design, code, trademarks, and content—remain the sole property of the Service Provider. You are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Applicaton for personal, non-commercial purposes only.
    </p>

    <h2>Subscriptions and Fees</h2>
    <p>
      Some features of the Applicaton may be locked behind a paid subscription. Any applicable fees will be disclosed clearly within the Applicaton. Subscriptions are managed via the App Store or Google Play and may auto-renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing cycle. You are responsible for managing your subscription settings through your app store account.
    </p>

    <h2>Data, Analytics, and Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Application collects only the minimum necessary data for functionality and analytics (e.g., usage stats, crash reports). For details on how data is handled, please refer to the 
      <a href="/ConverterGo/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The Applicaton may rely on third-party services, each governed by their own terms:</p>

      <li><a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/terms">RevenueCat</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Connectivity and Device Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      Some features may require an active internet connection. You are responsible for any data, network, or roaming charges incurred. The Service Provider is not liable for service interruptions due to low battery or device failure.
    </p>

    <h2>Updates and Compatibility</h2>
    <p>
      The Applicaton may automatically update to maintain compatibility or improve performance. You agree to receive such updates. The Service Provider may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Applicaton or any of its features at any time without notice.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      While the Application is designed to be accurate and up-to-date, the Service Provider makes no guarantees regarding the accuracy, reliability, or availability of the Applicaton's content. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service Provider disclaims all liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Applicaton. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This includes, but is not limited to, loss of data, financial loss, or decisions made in reliance on incorrect or incomplete data provided by the Applicaton.
    </p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using the Applicaton at any time. The Service Provider reserves the right to terminate or restrict your access to the Applicaton at any time without notice, especially in the event of a breach of these Terms. Upon termination, you must cease using the Applicaton and delete it from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms may be updated from time to time. Review this page for changes. Continued use of the Application after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of the Republic of Korea (South Korea). Any disputes arising under or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in South Korea.
